            <div class="questions"> Q: How do you manage your time between taking care of your cat and your schoolwork?</div>
                <p class="answers"> <b>A:</b>Cats are easy to take care of, they are independent and as long as they will have their corner with toys, you will have time to study in peace. <p>
            <div class="questions"> Q:How to make sure the cat uses the litter when you are gone?</div>
                <p class="answers"> <b>A:</b> There are few things that influence how a cat is using the litter:
                    <span>
                        <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/best-cat-litters/">the litter itself</a>,

                        and their <a href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/cornell-feline-health-center/health-information/feline-health-topics/feeding-your-cat">diet</a>.
                    </span> I would recommend biodegradable materials for the litter, as it is not harmful in any way to the cat. When I just got my cat, he did not use the litter for two days because it was in the open, and felt uncomfortable. Making sure that they have a sense of privacy is crucial. As for the diet, the vet can recommend certain brands, depending on your cat's needs, but we are using the brand

            <div class="questions"> Q: What to do if you have to leave for couple days?</div>
                <p class="answers"> <b>A:</b> Depending on the way a cat eats, you can leave food and water at their disposal for a couple of days, but if your cat is always trying to eat everything, the best thing is to just ask a friend to stop by and feed them once or twice a day. </p>
            <div class="questions"> Q: How do I know when is time for my cat to be neutered? </div>
                <p class="answers"> <b>A:</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutering">Neutering</a> your cat is important for them since it does influence their behavior. If not neutered, they are more agitated and require more attention. The best time to neuter your cat is during the 6-8 mounths period, which is the time when their sexual life starts.</p>
